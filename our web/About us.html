<p>My name is Simphiwe Kuze, and it is a privilege and an honor to be joining the Mzamomtsha Primary School team. My family, (wife, Babalwa, son, Ovuyo, daughter, Ovayo) and I are Xhosa natives.  We spent the last three years in Uitenhage, Port Elizabeth, which is in Eastern Cape, and are beyond excited to bein Cape Town. I have read and heard nothing but incredible information about the strength of the Mzamomtsha Primary School and community.  Each time I interact with any member of the school, community, or district, the message has been the same, “You are very lucky. You landed in a beautiful place, and at an exceptional school.”  Please know, I don’t take that fact lightly.  My goal is to jump in, continue to learn about the community, and work tirelessly to lead our school in a positive direction.</p><b>
</b>

<p>I love serving as a principal!  My passion is developing positive relationships with everyone within the community, working with students as they grow, supporting teachers and staff so that they can reach their greatest potential, strengthening a connection between school and home, and a fostering a positive school culture.  At our core, we know that the school to home partnership is what allows us to provide an extraordinary school experience for all students.  I look forward to meeting each of you and learning how I can best support you throughout this year, and many more to come.</p>
